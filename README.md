ATM Interface – Java Console Application

📌 Objective

The objective of this project is to design and implement a console-based ATM Interface using Java.
The system allows users to create their own User ID and PIN, authenticate securely, and perform basic banking operations such as checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing cash, transferring funds, and viewing transaction history.

🛠️ Tools Used

Java – Programming language
Jvdroid (Mobile IDE) – For writing and executing Java code on mobile
GitHub – For version control and project submission

⚙️ Steps Performed

Designed a console-based ATM system using Java.
Implemented a user registration module to create User ID and PIN.
Added a login authentication system to validate user credentials.
Developed ATM functionalities:
Transaction History
Deposit
Withdraw
Transfer
